# GoBrew: V1 F23 Cohort Project

#### Problem Statement

It is too hard to reach out to upperclassmen for advice and learn about people’s involvement at UMich. Current solutions such as LinkedIn are too professional and intimidating for students to reach out to each other. Additionally, scheduling meetings requires the use of other apps such as Google Calendars. It would be an easy way for clubs to centralize all of their member’s contact information.

#### General Market

College students (for now) / Academically based social clubs
